<h1>Car Dealer Web Project</h1>

Welcome to the Car Dealer Project! This project allows logged-in users to post their car advertisements, interact with their own posts by editing and deleting them, and engage with other users' posts by commenting. Non-owners of a post can comment on the post but cannot edit or delete it. Additionally, logged-in users can subscribe/unsubscribe to car posts of which they are not the owners.

<h2>Features</h2>

    <li><strong>User Authentication</strong>: Users can register and login to the site to access personalized features.</li>
    <li><strong>Post Advertisements</strong>: Logged-in users can create and post car advertisements, providing details such as car model, year, price, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Edit and Delete Posts</strong>: Owners of a post can edit and delete their own advertisements as needed.</li>
    <li><strong>Comments</strong>: Users can comment on advertisements, but only the user that they are not the owners of the posts.</li>
    <li><strong>Subscribe to Posts</strong>: Logged-in users can subscribe and unsubscribe to car posts of which they are not the owners.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile Page</strong>: Every logged-in user has a profile page where they can view their posted car ads and manage their subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalog Page</strong>: All users have access to a catalog page where they can browse through all car advertisements, with a search bar for easy navigation.</li>
  </ul>
